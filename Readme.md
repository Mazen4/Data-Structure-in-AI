as already we have knew that AI is a field of Computer Sciences Fields , the most of the future will be built on this field we all want to have robots someday to do the hard jobs like cleaning and serving in the house and this will happen by using AI because you can't teach the machine everything so you have to teach her only how to learn and then it will enrich its knowledge to help us in the future .
we as a humans we think by using many principles but there's nobody told us them but the machine is different because we are Allah's Creatures but the machine is made by a human so we have to teach it how to think and this is an impossible mission to do if you will not use Data Structures  .
Data Structures is like a cubes or bricks which you use to build a certain building or shape but we also use an algorithms to use a set of data types to make the required shape of a data structures
Let's take some examples of types of data structures
1)	Linked Lists: is a popular type of data structures which we should use when we need a list. Linked Lists are generally used when we need a quick insertion and deletion.
Example:
Inserting complementary items into a grocery list when thereâ€™s a high probability that the two items will be used together (Tooth brush & toothpaste).
This type of data structure definitely we will usually use it as we need to store a database of some information into any product of AI like robots , Auto-Pilot devices , video games and smart home devices .
2)	Recursion : Recursion is critical because it allows you to progressively refine data or to subdivide a problem into chunks and handle the chunks in smaller and smaller pieces.

Think about how QuickSort works. Instead of trying to tackle the entire list of data, it subdivides it and processes it in small chunks, which saves RAM and ends up being a lot faster! Recursion is used this same way in game development (and in other ways, too.)

One common use of recursion is octrees. It's not necessarily recursive from a code perspective, but basically it divides a volume of space up into progressively smaller and smaller square chunks, so that any object in space is located in one or more of those chunks. This means that when you want to do collision detection or rendering, you can iterate through a few chunks instead of having to iterate ALL of the objects in your game world.

Another example of recursion in games - Chess AI. most good chess AI code attempts to predict what moves the opponent will make. Usually, it will predict all the possible moves for the next turn. Then it recursively predicts all the possible moves for the turn after that, and so on. After that, it ranks each possible move using some sort of 'value' algorithm, and then each sequence of moves is given an overall score, and the AI picks the one with the highest score. You can do this without recursion, but the code becomes WAY more complicated, because you're basically faking recursion instead of getting it 'for free' with function calls and the stack.

Some other game-related things that make use of recursion:

Pathfinding - Most good pathfinding algorithms branch off in a few directions from the start location, and recursively branch off from there in more and more directions, testing various paths to the destination and determining which path is easiest. This can be done without recursion, but it's much more difficult to implement.

Lighting - Some of the more accurate and efficient lighting techniques used these days are recursive. Radiosity, for example, is an inherently recursive algorithm, though it's not infinitely recursive. Ray tracing also exhibits some recursive tendencies, depending on your implementation.
